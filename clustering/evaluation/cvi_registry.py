"""Cluster validity index (CVI) registry.

Adding an index is one ``CVI_REGISTRY`` entry and nothing else: the sweep
(``BaseClustering.optimal_k_analysis``), the summary dataframe, and
``OptimalKPlotter`` all iterate this registry instead of naming metrics
inline. Engine-specific extras (inertia, AIC/BIC/NLL) are not CVIs and do
not belong here — engines declare them separately.

Cost arithmetic for new entries: every entry runs once per ``(seed, k)``.
``number_of_seeds`` is a UI setting (default 3, max 100) and ``k_values``
is ``range(2, 11)``, so a sweep evaluates each metric 27 to 900 times.
The Dunn family shares one condensed pairwise-distance vector through a
content-addressed single-entry cache (``_condensed_distances``), so
``pdist`` — O(n^2 d) time, O(n^2) memory; measured ~6 ms at n=200 (the
Time Series path), ~0.2 s at n=1681 (name clustering, use-all-data), ~2 s
at n=5000 — runs once per distinct X (in the sweep: once per seed), and
each variant call pays only its block reductions. sklearn's
silhouette / Davies-Bouldin / Calinski-Harabasz compute their own
distances internally and neither use nor populate this cache. Any new
O(n^2) metric added here inherits the seeds-times-k multiplier unless it
reuses the cache.

The Dunn entries are members of Bezdek & Pal's generalized Dunn family:
an inter-cluster separation measure ``d`` over an intra-cluster diameter
measure ``D`` — min over cluster pairs of d, divided by max over clusters
of D, maximized. The full family is 18 variants (six separation measures
crossed with three diameters); only the measures below are implemented,
and a further one is a single entry in the lookup dicts. The variant
choice is not cosmetic: on the SSA baby-name data, variants scored on
identical partitions select k anywhere from 2 to 9 — a wider spread than
between Dunn, Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz combined.
Implemented measures, in words:

- ``d1`` — minimum distance between points in different clusters
  (single linkage; Dunn's original 1974 numerator)
- ``d2`` — maximum distance between points in different clusters
  (complete linkage)
- ``d3`` — mean distance over all cross-cluster point pairs
  (average linkage)
- ``d4`` — euclidean distance between cluster centroids
- ``D1`` — maximum pairwise distance within a cluster (its diameter;
  Dunn's original denominator)
- ``D2`` — mean pairwise distance within a cluster

On the two silhouettes: every series on the Time Series path is
z-normalized, so all vectors have equal norm. For equal-norm vectors
``||a - b||^2 = 2T(1 - rho)`` while ``cos(a, b) = rho`` — cosine and
euclidean distance are monotone transforms of each other, so the two
variants order partitions identically and select the same k; they are not
independent evidence there. Their *values* still diverge systematically
with noise, because silhouette is a ratio statistic and the square root
compresses large distances (measured cosine minus euclidean on the easy
three-class list: 0.103/0.177/0.222 at sigma 0.1/0.2/0.3, cosine higher).
They can genuinely differ on the name-count paths, where scaling choices
leave norms unequal.
